# The below setting is needed to fix the error:
# DENIED Redis is running in protected mode because protected mode is enabled, no bind address was specified, 
# no authentication password is requested to clients. In this mode connections are only accepted from the loopback interface. 
# If you want to connect from external computers to Redis you may adopt one of the following solutions: 
# 
# 1) Just disable protected mode sending the command 'CONFIG SET protected-mode no' from the loopback 
# interface by connecting to Redis from the same host the server is running, however MAKE SURE Redis is not publicly accessible from internet if you do so. 
# Use CONFIG REWRITE to make this change permanent. 
# 
# 2) Alternatively you can just disable the protected mode by editing the Redis configuration file, 
# and setting the protected mode option to 'no', and then restarting the server. 
# 
# 3) If you started the server manually just for testing, restart it with the '--protected-mode no' option. 
#
# 4) Setup a bind address or an authentication password. 
# NOTE: You only need to do one of the above things in order for the server to start accepting connections from the outside.
